# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project contains a tic-tac-toe game developed in Python.

## How to Play

1. The game is played between two players, taking turns. One player represents the X symbol, while the other player represents the O symbol.
2. Players take turns making moves on a 3x3 game board.
3. Players place their symbol on an empty space on the board during their turn.
4. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
5. If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has achieved a winning condition, the game ends in a draw.
